    "text": "Not continuing working on what seemed to be working\nIt is, not continuing working on what seemed to be working.\nYes. It is as that simple. Yesterday, I shared with Abdulhamid, my friend who is building with me, about a startup that executed our second Idea. He was amazed. Looking back it seems that we made the same mistake. Abdulhamid joined me later after my other 2 friends left and we started working on the 2nd Idea so he is referring to our 2nd Idea when he is saying ‘first idea’.\n\n\n\nA message from Abdulhamid\n\n\nWe stopped it because we thought many businesses in our country were not at that level yet to need our solution. Guess what? They do have that problem and It was possible all along as Abdulhamid put it. It is a lesson I learned the hard way. It is a lesson we learned the hard way. Don’t make the same mistakes."

You won’t procrastinate easily. It is like a deadline on a class project you have to submit in a few days or weeks. It can be an exciting experience."

    "text": "Not shipping fast\nWe raised the stakes early. Also we sometimes used new technologies we were not familiar with. Yes, you learn new stuff and that is good but it is could be a an obstacle that makes you procrastinate. This is a problem in the early days because you don’t have a product and a customer. You can always improve the product later. So build with the technologies you already know. Get the fist version out early.\nI think part of the problem was that we tried to build a startup instead of just enjoying building the project for fun. We raised the stakes so we ended up seeking perfection in our MVP and it easier to procrastinate at that point. You can find many big companies that were not a startup in the first place.\n\nSolution: Ship faaaast\nIt is simple. Don’t make the stakes high. Just have fun building it. Get the mvp out as soon as possible.\nI once read something along the lines If you have dark mode when you ship, you are too late!. Ship fast. Get feedback.\nYou should be interested in the problem you are solving. You can come up with better solution if you focus on the problem instead of thinking your solution is the best. Don’t fall into analysis-paralysis. This is a fancy way to say don’t analyze too much in your head and just ship, get feedback and improve it from that point.\nOk, so what I am doing these days? I am at home. I am trying one last Idea before starting looking for a new role. I am building it with Abdulhamid. I prefer building something of my own instead of getting a regular 9-5 job. But there is an exception here. I am open to interesting roles and opportunities. That being said, I hope it works this time, insha’Allah.\nHint: We are building something for business owners.
