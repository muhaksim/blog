I am Muhammad Abdullahi. I am really interested in leveraging tech to solve real problems.

Currently, I am trying to learn more about deep learning. I am coming from a software engineering background. I am excited about all the amazing progress in the space. I am excited to contribute to the space because I think there could be many low-hanging fruits in the applied space now more than ever.

I am familiar with Flutter, Nodejs, FastAPI, Python, JavaScript, and NextJS.
