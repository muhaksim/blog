So in 2022 I started working on an idea with some friends. We didn't ship anything although months passed. Two of my co-founders ended up leaving the project for different reasons as I guess.\n\n# Mistake #1\n\n![A Cover photo of the 1st Idea](first_idea.jpeg)\n\nOur hypothesis was that many business owners don't know how to use a computer and they have to invest in a new computer and hire someone to digitize their businesses and move from the pen and paper way.\n\nWhat should we do here? They use a smartphone right? Why not give them an app in their smart phone to let them manage their businesses easily. By this way, they can manage their businesses by themselves. They can get the info they want 24/7.\n\nI talked to some businesses owners. I learned they don't use a computer in their businesses. One of them of was hesitant about using tech at all as I remember. One of them was using a computer in his businesses but they were using an old software in my opinion. He was kinda happy with it from what I remember. I also learned there was an app in the market used by some businesses men. It was working almost like the way our Idea should work.\n\nGuess what? We stopped working on the idea for several reasons. Our second Idea was also a good one. We were working on it months ago. It is kinda now became popular. We made the same mistake. We had our reasons for each case we stopped but it wasn't the wisest decision. So what is the mistake?\n\n## Mistake #1: Not continuing working on what seemed to be working\n\nIt is not continuing working on what seemed to be working.\n\nYes. It is as that simple. I sent Abdulhamid, my friend who is building with me, about a startup that executed our second Idea. He was amazed. Looking back it seems that we made the same mistake. Abdulhamid joined me later after my other 2 friends left and we started working on the 2nd Idea so he is referring to our 2nd Idea when he is saying 'first idea'.\n\n![A message from Abdulhamid ](screenshot.png)\n\nWe stopped on it because we thought many businesses were not at that level yet to need our solution. Guess what? They do have that problem and It was possible all along as Abdulhamid put it. It is a lesson I learned the hard way. It is a lesson we learned the hard way. Don't make the same mistake.\n\n## Solution: Talk to your customers earlier\n\nThis will allow you to figure out the real pain points. Also it could allow you to get momentum since their is a customer waiting your solution. You won't procrastinate easily. It is like a deadline on a class project you have to submit in a few days or weeks.\n\n# Mistake #2\n\nThe second one is a one I am still struggling with. I think part of the problem was that we tried to build a startup instead of just enjoying building the project for fun.\n\n## Mistake #2: Not shipping fast\n\nWe raised the stakes early. Also we sometimes used new technologies we were not familiar with. Yes, you learn new stuff and that is good but it is could be a an obstacle that makes you procrastinate. This is a problem in the early days because you don't have a product and a customer. You can always improve the product later.\n\nI think part of the problem was that we tried to build a startup instead of just enjoying building the project for fun. We raised the stakes so we ended up seeking perfection in our MVP and it easier to procrastinate at that point. You can find many big companies that were not a startup in the first place.\n\n### Solution: Ship faaaast\n\nIt is simple. Don't make stakes high. Just have fun building it. Get the mvp out as soon as possible.\n\nI once read something along the lines `If you have dark mode when you ship, you are late!`. Ship fast. Get feedback.\n\nYou should be interested in the problem you are solving. You can come up with better solution if you focus on the problem instead of thinking your solution is the best. Don't fall into analysis-paralysis. This is a fancy way to say don't analyze too much in your head and just ship, get feedback and improve it from that point.\n\nFeel free to subscribe to received my upcoming posts in your inbox, insha'Allah.\n\nFeel free to reach out and share some feedback: `muhammadkaasim3 [@] GMAIL [DOT] COM`","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Background story\n\nI like building startups.
